When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.  The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it."

You gain a +1 bonus to Saving Throws while you wear it. \nSix stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast Magic Missile as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe. \nWhile you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space."

As he looked on, he was immediately grasped by the instinct to eat the birdseed, taking all the self-control he had to refrain from jumping from the window.  While he was able to avoid injuring himself in that manner, his party members returned later to find him being fed by the old lady."

And as far as he's concerned, that's their problem.",
